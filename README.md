BarrelRace
==========
BarrelRace is a Simple Game for Android written in Java. The physics of the game, though very simple, are written from ground up without using any external libraries. The Game makes use of the Motion Sensors in the phone to control the game.

**Game:**
The BarrelRace Game is a Rodeo event where there is a rider on a horse who enters a gate and circles the barrels (3 Barrels in this case). There is a clock which starts when the rider enters the gate and runs until the rider circles all the barrels. If the rider collides with the barrel the game ends. If the rider hits the fence(rectangular) then 5 seconds is added to the clock as penalty.

**Features:**
This game uses Motion sensors to control the horse(rider). The horse can be maneuvered left of right by tilting the device. The clock time is recorded when the game ends successfully where the user enters his/her name. The top 10 scores can be viewed under Highscores. The Game Settings include options to select different difficulty levels and also sound can be toggled on/off.
